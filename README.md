 # Unit Converter Web Application

The Unit Converter is a web application designed to simplify the process of converting values between different units across various measurement categories, including Length, Mass, Temperature, and Volume.

## How to Use the App

1. **Enter the Value**:
   - In the input field labeled "Enter value", type the numerical value you wish to convert.
2. **Select the Input Unit**:
   - From the first dropdown menu, choose the unit of the value you've entered. Units are organized into categories for easy navigation.
3. **Select the Output Unit**:
   - In the second dropdown menu, select the unit you want to convert the value to, ensuring it's within the same category as the input unit.
4. **Perform the Conversion**:
   - Click the "Convert" button to execute the conversion. The converted value will appear in the "Converted value" field and is read-only to prevent accidental editing.

## Features

- **Multiple Categories**: Convert units within Length, Mass, Temperature, and Volume categories.
- **Extensive Unit Options**: Access a wide range of units such as Meters, Miles, Kilograms, Pounds, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Liters, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Dropdown menus and clear input fields make the app intuitive and easy to use.
- **Error Handling**: The app alerts you if you enter an invalid number or attempt to convert between units from different categories.

## Note

- **Same Category Conversion**: Ensure that both the input and output units are from the same category (e.g., converting Length units to other Length units).
- **Temperature Conversions**: Special calculations are handled for Temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

This app streamlines unit conversions by providing an all-in-one tool without the need to manually calculate or use separate converters for different unit types.
